# AntiFishing
A lightweight plugin for Minecraft that stops autofishing machines and bots by moving the player's look direction ever so slightly every time they successfully reel in a catch.

##Development
This plugin was tested and developed on Paper for the Minecraft version 1.19. It should work on future versions due to the simplicity of the plugin.

##Dependencies
